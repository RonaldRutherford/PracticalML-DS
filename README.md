The code in PracticalMLAssF.r uses two algorythms. The first is just a simple Decision tree. The simplicity of the model allows greater scrutiny of the factors and how the data might be manipulated to get better results. 

The second method call was random forests. While the first method got only 40% of the test samples right, random forests got 100% accuracy!!!
